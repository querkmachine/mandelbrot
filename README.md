# Mandelbrot

A tiny fork of Fractal's [Mandelbrot](https://github.com/frctl/mandelbrot) theme that adds and tweaks a few bits:

* Adds a 'params' component panel that displays documentation from a params.yaml file.
* Removes Open Sans and uses a system font stack instead.
* Removes `font` shorthand and most places the font family is referenced so it can more easily be overriden.
